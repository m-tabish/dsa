### **Heuristic for Reading Technical Articles**

When you read these, don't just passively consume the text. Actively engage with it:

  * **Find the Invariant:** What condition or state is always true in the algorithm? For sliding window, it's the property of the window. For two pointers, it's the sorted nature of the array.
  * **Identify the State Transition:** For DP problems, write down the recurrence relation yourself. `dp[i] = function(dp[i-1], ...)`
  * **Code the Template:** Before solving the problem, type out the generic template for the pattern from the article in a blank file. This builds muscle memory.

This approach of interleaving theory with targeted practice is the fastest way to solidify your knowledge. Good luck.
