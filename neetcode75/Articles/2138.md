Here's the full write-up with complete explanations in a clean and professional style, as if written by a human:

# Intuition

The problem requires splitting a string `s` into equal-length substrings of size `k`. If the final substring has fewer than `k` characters, we must pad it with the given `fill` character. Immediately, it seems like we can iterate through the string in steps of `k` and handle the last chunk separately if it’s shorter than `k`.

---

# Approach

We explore two solutions:

### 1. Using `ArrayList<String>`:

* We initialize an `ArrayList` to collect each `k`-sized substring.
* We iterate through the string in steps of `k` and add complete chunks to the list.
* If there is a remainder (i.e., the last chunk is shorter than `k`), we extract the remaining characters and append the `fill` character until its length becomes `k`.
* Finally, we convert the `ArrayList` to a `String[]` and return it.

### 2. Using a regular `String[]`:

* First, calculate how many chunks we will have. If the string length is divisible by `k`, it's simply `s.length()/k`; otherwise, we add one more for the final padded chunk.
* Allocate a `String[]` of the calculated size.
* Iterate through the string, filling the array with complete `k`-sized chunks.
* If there's a remainder, pad the final chunk with the `fill` character and add it to the array.

Both approaches are similar in logic, but the second one (using a static array) might be slightly faster since it avoids dynamic resizing and conversion overhead.

# Complexity

* **Time Complexity:**
  $O(n)$ — where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed exactly once.

* **Space Complexity:**
  $O(n)$ — we store the resulting substrings in a new array, which in the worst case holds `n/k + 1` strings of length `k`.

### ✅ Using `ArrayList`

```java
class Solution {
    public String[] divideString(String s, int k, char fill) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

        int j = 0;
        while (j + k <= s.length()) {
            list.add(s.substring(j, j + k));
            j += k;
        }

        if (j < s.length()) {
            StringBuilder lastPart = new StringBuilder(s.substring(j));
            while (lastPart.length() < k) {
                lastPart.append(fill);
            }
            list.add(lastPart.toString());
        }

        return list.toArray(new String[0]);
    }
}
```

### ✅ Using `String[]`

```java

class Solution {
    public String[] divideString(String s, int k, char fill) { 
        int numGroups = s.length()%k==0?s.length()/k:s.length()/k+1;
        String[] list = new String[numGroups];
        int count=0 ;
        int j=0;
        while (j + k <= s.length()) {
            list[count++]= s.substring(j, j + k);
            j += k;
        }

        if (s.length() % k != 0) {
            String str = s.substring((s.length() / k) * k, s.length());
            while (str.length() < k) {
                str += fill;
            } 
            list[count] = str;
        }
 
        return list;
    }
}
```
