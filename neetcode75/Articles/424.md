## üîÅ LeetCode 424: Longest Repeating Character Replacement

### üß© Problem Statement:

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character in the string and **replace it with any other uppercase English letter**, up to `k` times. Your task is to **return the length of the longest substring** that can be formed with the same letter after at most `k` replacements.

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Example:

#### Input:

```text
s = "AABABBA", k = 1
```

#### Output:

```text
4
```

#### Explanation:

We can replace the second 'B' with 'A' to get `"AAABBA"`, which has `"AAAB"` as a valid window of size 4.

---

## üí° Intuition:

We want the **longest substring** where we can **change at most `k` characters** to make the entire substring consist of the **same letter**.

---

## üß† Approach: Sliding Window + Frequency Count

### üîπ Key Idea:

Use a **sliding window** and keep track of:

* The **count of each character** in the current window
* The **max frequency** of any single character in the window

To make all characters in the window the same, we need to change all the other characters (i.e., `window size - maxFreq`).
If this number is **‚â§ k**, it's valid. Otherwise, **shrink the window**.

## ‚úÖ Java Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int[] count = new int[26];
        int maxFreq = 0, left = 0, result = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            count[s.charAt(right) - 'A']++;
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, count[s.charAt(right) - 'A']);

            // If more than k chars need to be replaced, shrink the window
            while ((right - left + 1) - maxFreq > k) {
                count[s.charAt(left) - 'A']--;
                left++;
            }

            result = Math.max(result, right - left + 1);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity:

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`

  * Each character is processed at most twice (once by `right`, once by `left`)
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

  * Fixed-size array of 26 for uppercase English letters

---

## üîç Dry Run (for s = "AABABBA", k = 1):

| Window         | MaxFreq | Changes Needed | Valid? | Result |
| -------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------ | ------ |
| "A"            | 1       | 0              | ‚úÖ      | 1      |
| "AA"           | 2       | 0              | ‚úÖ      | 2      |
| "AAB"          | 2       | 1              | ‚úÖ      | 3      |
| "AABA"         | 2       | 2              | ‚ùå      | Shrink |
| "ABA"          | 2       | 1              | ‚úÖ      | 3      |
| ... and so on. |         |                |        |        |

Eventually, it finds `"ABBA"` with 1 replacement ‚Üí max length = **4**
