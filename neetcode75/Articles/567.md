## 🧩 Problem: 567. Permutation in String

> Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `true` if `s2` contains a **permutation** of `s1`, or `false` otherwise.

A permutation of a string is another string that contains the same characters, **only the order can be different**.

---

### 🧪 Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: true
Explanation: "ba" is a permutation of "ab" and is in s2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: false
```

## 🧠 Intuition

We want to find out if **any substring** of `s2` of length equal to `s1` is a **permutation** of `s1`.

Two strings are permutations if their **character counts are equal**.

This leads to a natural **sliding window** approach where:

* The window is of size `s1.length()`
* We compare the character counts of the current window in `s2` with `s1`

---

## 🚀 Approach: Sliding Window + Frequency Comparison

### Steps:

1. Count frequencies of all characters in `s1` (`count1`)
2. Create a sliding window in `s2` of size `s1.length()`, and count characters in the current window (`count2`)
3. Compare `count1` and `count2` at each step:

   * If they match, return `true`
   * If not, slide the window by 1 character and update `count2`

---

## ✅ Java Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkInclusion(String s1, String s2) {
        if (s1.length() > s2.length()) return false;

        int[] count1 = new int[26];  // frequency of s1
        int[] count2 = new int[26];  // frequency of sliding window in s2

        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
            count1[s1.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            count2[s2.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }

        if (Arrays.equals(count1, count2)) return true;

        for (int i = s1.length(); i < s2.length(); i++) {
            count2[s2.charAt(i) - 'a']++;  // add new char
            count2[s2.charAt(i - s1.length()) - 'a']--;  // remove old char

            if (Arrays.equals(count1, count2)) return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

---

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`

  * `n = s2.length()`
  * Each character is processed a constant number of times
  * `Arrays.equals()` compares two arrays of length 26 → O(26) ≈ O(1)

* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

  * Only two fixed-size arrays (`int[26]`) are used

---

## 🧵 Conclusion

LeetCode 567 is a great example of how a **fixed-length sliding window** with **frequency counting** can help solve substring permutation problems efficiently.

### Key Concepts:

* Sliding window of size `s1.length()`
* Frequency count comparison using arrays
