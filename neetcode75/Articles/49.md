# 🧩 Group Anagrams in Java: Two Effective Techniques

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word, such as `"listen"` and `"silent"`. In coding interviews and practice problems, grouping anagrams from a list of strings is a classic challenge. In Java, we can solve this elegantly using two primary techniques:

---

## ✨ Problem Statement

Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.
**Example Input**:

```java
["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
```

**Expected Output**:

```java
[["eat","tea","ate"],["tan","nat"],["bat"]]
```

---

## ✅ Technique 1: Sorting Each String

### 💡 Idea

Two anagrams will have the **same sorted character sequence**. For example:

* `"eat"`, `"tea"`, and `"ate"` → all become `"aet"` when sorted.

We use this sorted string as a **key in a HashMap**, grouping all original strings that match this key.

### 📦 Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GroupAnagramsSort {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        HashMap<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (String str : strs) {
            char[] chars = str.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(chars);
            String key = new String(chars);

            map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(str);
        }

        return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
    }
}
```

### ✅ Pros

* Simple and intuitive
* Leverages Java's built-in sorting

### ⚠️ Cons

* Sorting each string takes `O(n log n)` time, which can be costly for large inputs

---

## ✅ Technique 2: Using Character Frequency as Key (HashMap + Arrays)

### 💡 Idea

Instead of sorting, we count the frequency of each character in a string and use that count array as a unique **signature** for the string.

For example, `"eat"` and `"tea"` both have:

* 1 'a', 1 'e', 1 't', and 0 of all other characters → same signature.

We convert this frequency array into a string (e.g., `"1_0_0_..._1_1_..."`) and use it as a map key.

### 📦 Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GroupAnagramsFreq {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        HashMap<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (String str : strs) {
            int[] count = new int[26];
            for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
                count[c - 'a']++;
            }

            StringBuilder keyBuilder = new StringBuilder();
            for (int freq : count) {
                keyBuilder.append(freq).append('#'); // '#' separates counts
            }

            String key = keyBuilder.toString();
            map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(str);
        }

        return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
    }
}
```

### ✅ Pros

* Avoids sorting → faster on average (`O(n)` per string)
* Great for long strings or massive datasets

### ⚠️ Cons

* Slightly more complex logic
* Needs careful key construction to avoid collisions

## 🧠 Conclusion

Both techniques are effective for grouping anagrams in Java:

| Technique       | Time Complexity  | Space Complexity | Best For                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Sorting         | `O(n * k log k)` | `O(n * k)`       | Simpler cases, short strings             |
| Frequency Count | `O(n * k)`       | `O(n * k)`       | Larger inputs, performance-critical apps |

> ✅ Tip: `k` is the average length of the strings, and `n` is the number of strings.

For interviews or production systems, the frequency count method is often preferred due to better scalability.
