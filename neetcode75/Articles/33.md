## 🔍 Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

### 🧠 What’s the Problem?

You're given a **sorted array** that has been **rotated** at some unknown pivot. Your task is to **find the index** of a target value in this array.

For example:

```java
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0  
Output: 4
```

Even though the array was originally sorted (`[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]`), it's now rotated. But we still want to **search efficiently**, ideally in **O(log n)** time.

### 🔧 How to Solve?

We use a **modified binary search**:

1. Find the `mid` index.
2. If `nums[mid]` is the target, return it.
3. Check **which half is sorted**:

   * If `nums[l] <= nums[mid]`, the **left half is sorted**.

     * If the target lies in that range, search left.
     * Otherwise, search right.
   * Else, the **right half is sorted**.

     * If the target lies in that range, search right.
     * Otherwise, search left.

### ✅ Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int l = 0, h = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (l <= h) {
            int mid = l + (h - l) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] == target)
                return mid;

            // Left half is sorted
            if (nums[l] <= nums[mid]) {
                if (target >= nums[l] && target < nums[mid])
                    h = mid - 1;
                else
                    l = mid + 1;
            } 
            // Right half is sorted
            else {
                if (target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[h])
                    l = mid + 1;
                else
                    h = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // Not found
    }
}
```

### 📝 Summary

* Use binary search.
* Identify the sorted half.
* Narrow your search based on where the target could be.
* Time complexity stays **O(log n)**.

This approach is efficient and works even if the array is rotated!
