## Finding the Minimum in a Rotated Sorted Array

The main idea is that an element is the minimum in a rotated sorted array if the previous element is greater than it, or if there is no previous element (i.e., the array is not rotated). This can be efficiently found using **binary search**.

### Steps

1. **Find the mid element:**  
    `mid = (low + high) / 2`

2. **Check if the next element is the minimum:**  
    If the `(mid + 1)`th element is less than the `mid` element, then return the `(mid + 1)`th element.

3. **Check if the mid element is the minimum:**  
    If the `mid` element is less than the `(mid - 1)`th element, then return the `mid` element.

4. **Decide which half to search next:**  
    - If the last element is greater than the `mid` element, search in the **left half**.
    - If the last element is less than the `mid` element, search in the **right half**.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
