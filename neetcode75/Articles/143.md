## 🔄 Reorder List

### 🧠 Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list:

```
L₀ → L₁ → … → Lₙ₋₁ → Lₙ
```

Reorder it to:

```
L₀ → Lₙ → L₁ → Lₙ₋₁ → L₂ → Lₙ₋₂ → …
```

You must do this **in-place**, without altering node values or using extra arrays.

### 🔧 Three-Step Solution

1. **Find the Middle**

   * Use **slow** and **fast** pointers.
   * When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` is at midpoint.

2. **Reverse the Second Half**

   * Starting from `slow.next`, reverse the links in one pass.
   * Cut the list at the middle (`slow.next = null`).

3. **Merge Alternately**

   * Take one node from the first half, then one from the reversed second half.
   * Continue until all nodes are merged.

### ✅ Java Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public void reorderList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return;

        // 1. Find middle
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        // 2. Reverse second half
        ListNode prev = null, curr = slow.next;
        slow.next = null;  // split
        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode nextTemp = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextTemp;
        }

        // 3. Merge halves
        ListNode first = head, second = prev;
        while (second != null) {
            ListNode t1 = first.next, t2 = second.next;
            first.next = second;
            second.next = t1;
            first = t1;
            second = t2;
        }
    }
}
```

 
**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
